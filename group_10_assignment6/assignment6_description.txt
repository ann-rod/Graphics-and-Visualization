This project is meant to simulate an ecosystem with moving predators and prey.

Included Classes:

   (All members)
 - Ecosystem: Manages the interactions between Hawks, Birds, and Bees.

   (Anneris)
 - Bird: a Boid-like object that moves based off attractive and repulsive "forces"
         within the canvas. Each bird flocks toward other nearby Birds, avoids Hawks,
         and seeks out Bees. Birds can die if eaten by Hawks, or reproduce if they eat
         bees. Birds are displayed as black ellipses with yellow beaks, and face the
         direction that they are traveling.

         Birds are not exactly Boids, as they do not function using a heading. Instead,
         they change thei velocity parameters based off the postition of other objects
         in relation to them.

   (Anneris)
 - Flock: Manages the movements and interactions between all Birds.
