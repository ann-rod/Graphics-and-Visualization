This is a Space Invaders/Galaga style game where the player
must shoot at aliens in order to win.

Rules:
    The player must move around the canvas and shoot projectiles
    in order to defend from an incoming alien attack. Aliens
    will shoot at the player and slowly creep toward the bottom
    of the screen unless killed by the player. Barriers offer some
    cover from alien fire, but are gradually destroyed in the
    process.

Win/Lose Conditions:
    To win, the player must destroy all enemy aliens.

    If the alien lower the player's HP to zero or reach
    the bottom of the screen, the player loses.


Class Descriptions:
  
  Star: (Anneris)
      a small white circle at any position in the background
  
  StarManager: (Anneris)
      creates and manages a set of Star objects with
      user-given parameters.
  
  Alien: (Anneris)
      an enemy that holds a position and scale value. Alien
      objects move forward into position quickly and then
      creep towards bottom of screen.

      Alien objects change color-scheme when hit with a player
      projectile, and can shoot projectiles at the player.

      Alien objects appear as insectoid pink/green PImages.

  Alien Swarm: (Anneris)
      Creates a swarm of n rows of aliens with 7 aliens per row.
      Manages all Alien Objects, including when and if an Alien
      can shoot at the player. 

      Removes Alien if its HP hits zero, and updates the main
      game function on how many Aliens remain. 

Challenges:

  - Alien Sweeping: 
      Initially, Aliens were meant to make a large circular path
      towards the player as a secondary attack. This had to be
      scrapped as a logical way of coding this movement was not
      reached before the deadline.
