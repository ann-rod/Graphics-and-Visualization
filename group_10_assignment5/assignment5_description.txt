This animation is intended to depict vehicles in motion on/near an airport runway. 
This would be the aircraft and ground vehicles in the scene.

Classes:

  - Plane (Anneris): a plane object that moves forward a given distance then 
                     lifts up until offscreen. The plane graphic is a downloaded
                     .obj file.

  - LandingGear (Anneris): a sub-class of plane. This is a set of wheels attached
                           to the parent plane that lift up into the plane as the
                           objects go up in the air.


Challenges:
  - Using .obj: The .obj/.mtl files for the plane use spacing in the names. This
                could not be changed as the instructions in the .mtl files require
                the exact name given by the author. Therefore, it seems that the
                landing gear .obj file won't load on Windows computers but will on
                Macs. So far, this issue has not been solved.
