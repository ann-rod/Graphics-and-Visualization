Abdullah: I implemented the Vehicle superclass, the Sedan subclass, and a related class called Wheel. Vehicle has a body
	  PShape attribute that holds all the other shapes that actually form the body of a vehicle. This would include
	  the form of the Sedan vehicle type specifically and the wheels. Individual Vehicles can have
	  differing positions and speeds. Sedans also have a color. Wheels have their own position and rotation speed.
	  The Vehicle class has the move and display methods as those would be necessary for any vehicle. 
	  The Wheel class also rotates on its own. A Sedan object is a Vehicle that moves and has two Wheels that 
	  rotate independent of the movement of the overall vehicle, demonstrating composition, inheritance, and a 
	  scene hierarchy for the vehicles in the animation. I also did the simple rotating Sun class.

	  The animation for the vehicles are just two cars driving on opposite sides of the road. One car suddenly
	  brakes for a second before starting back again and going off screen just before the other car does.
